						<br>Tools used: Unity, C#, Visual Studio and Git<br>
						
						Roles: Game Programmer, Game Designer and Project Manager<br>
						
						<br>While developing The Structure with a team of 5, 
						I implemented multiple systems in the game based on the designs that the team and I made.
						Throughout the project, I helped the team in numerous ways like making extensive user stories, controlling project scope,
						helping teammates solve problems related to coding and solving merge conflicts. <br>

									<h3 class="title is-3">Boss finite state machine</h3>
									I wrote a finite state machine for the boss which includes the various states that the boss has. While writing
									the state machine in C# I made sure to write it so more states could be added later on. This state machine
									controls the several animations and transitions in the animator state machine and provides one access point for
									the boss state to be controlled.

									<br> <br>

									<h3 class="title is-3">Damage fallof and numbers</h3>
									I developed a system that changes the damage that the player does based on the distance between the player and the enemy.
									When a bullet hits an enemy a number is shown displaying the damage that the bullet did, based on the damage the color also changes.
									
									<br> <br>

									<br> <br>

									<br> <br>

									<h3 class="title is-3">Rockslide attack</h3>
									I implemented a Rockslide attack in the game by making use of the particle system in Unity. I changed these particles to fit the theme of the Rockslide
									and also added shadows and collisions to it. 
									
									<br> <br>

									<br> <br>

									<br> <br>

									<h3 class="title is-3">Player SphereCast</h3>
									The player in this game makes use of a kinematic Rigidbody which means that collisions won't work as intended. To prevent the player from leaving the arena
									I cast a sphere in front of the player that detects objects with the environment layer mask and exited out of the move method if the sphere collides with
									a GameObject.

									<br> <br>

									<h3 class="title is-3">Improved camera</h3>
									I wrote a script that zooms the camera out based on the distance between the player and the boss. 
									I also made the camera follow the player smoothly known as camera lerp.

									<br> <br>

									<h3 class="title is-3">Player and Boss Collision</h3>
									I wrote scripts that handle the collisions for both the player and the boss. In these scripts, I also added conditions and subtracted health if an attack landed.
